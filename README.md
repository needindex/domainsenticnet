# DomainSenticNet

<i>DomainSenticNet</i>, is an extension for the <i>OntoSenticNet</i> ontology which integrates each of the original 100,000 concepts in <i>OntoSenticNet</i> with a set of semantically related concepts, and domain distributional information.  
In particular, we mined semantically related concepts from the <i>WordNet</i> and <i>Probase</i> knowledge bases, while we compute domain distributional information using textual descriptions from the entire collection of domain-specific crowdfunding campaigns in Kickstarter.

Used in combination with <i>OntoSenticNet<i>, our resource can favor the development of novel hybrid Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis systems and research on Sentic Computing in domain-aware applications.
